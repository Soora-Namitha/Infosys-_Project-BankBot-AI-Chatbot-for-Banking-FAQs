[
[

BankBot AI is an intelligent chatbot developed for the Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship, designed to handle common banking FAQs using advanced NLP and configurable Large Language Models (LLMs). This project demonstrates full-stack development with Streamlit, focusing on NLU, intent recognition, and responsive UI for seamless user interactions.​

Features
Intent Recognition: Accurately identifies user queries related to accounts, transactions, loans, and cards using NLP techniques.​

Contextual Responses: Generates human-like replies via LLM-based text generation with prompt engineering for precision.​

Interactive UI: Streamlit-powered chat interface with real-time conversation history and responsive design.​

Configurable LLM: Easily switch between transformer-based models like GPT or open-source alternatives.​

Local Data Handling: SQLite database for logging interactions, enabling analysis and model improvements.​

Techniques Used
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Employs tokenization, entity extraction, and intent classification to process banking-specific queries effectively.​

Prompt Engineering
Crafts optimized prompts for LLMs to ensure relevant, concise responses tailored to banking contexts.​

LLM-based Text Generation
Leverages transformer architectures for dynamic response generation, supporting fallback to rule-based answers.​

Tech Stack
Programming Language
Python 3.8+ for core development and scripting.​

Libraries / Frameworks
Streamlit: Web-based UI for chatbot deployment.

Transformers (Hugging Face): LLM integration and fine-tuning.

SQLite: Lightweight database for session management.

AI / ML Technologies
NLP: spaCy or NLTK for preprocessing.

Transformers: BERT/GPT variants for NLU and generation.​

LLM Details
Utilizes configurable transformer-based LLMs (e.g., GPT-2, DistilBERT) via Hugging Face; users can specify models in config for flexibility across local or cloud setups.​
